<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of the project is to create a user-centric event management platform that enhances the
experience of students, faculty, and staff at the University of Toronto (UofT) by providing an accurate
and user-friendly solution for discovering, managing, and participating in events and activities. Our
platform aims to serve as a one stop solution which significantly reduces the time and effort required
to stay informed and engaged for students, clubs, and faculty members at the University of Toronto.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

We have dockerized the project to prevent any complications that might arise from different environments. To run the application locally you can:

- Initialize the python docker image using the Dockerfile we have added
```docker build -t python-docker .```

- Run the website locally on a specific port
```docker run -d -p 5000:5000 python-docker```

If the port 5000 is busy, you can replace it with other ports like 3000.


CHANGES TO STARTUP: 

- In order to run the application ensure docker and docker-compose are downloaded
- Run the website using:
 ``` docker-compose up -d ```
Note: the -d flag represents running the containers in detached mode. It basically will not show any logs on the terminal screen.
To show logs for docker compose:
``` docker-compose up ```

When re-running the code make sure to run: 
``` docker-compose up --build```
This will re-build your container as docker-compose tends to use the cached containers. 
Alternatively you can also use: ```docker-compose build --no-cache``` before you run the ```docker-compose up ```

After running the previous command, you should be able to access the website on your localhost:5000 link as we have been doing previously.

when you are done using the application, just run:
 ``` docker-compose down```
